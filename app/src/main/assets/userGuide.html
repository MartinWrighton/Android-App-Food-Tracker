    <p style="width:70%;">This app is designed to make it easier for users to track their dietary and water intakes. </br>
        It allows the user to enter their details in the profile and generate goals for them based on the UK governments guidelines. </br></br>
        These goals can be adjusted manually if the user wishes to do so.</p>

    <p style="width:70%;">The home screen shows the users logged values so far and allows the user to track new items by pressing either of the "track more" buttons. </br></br>
        Additionally the taskbar at the top allows the user to navigate easily to the calendar or profile, or to use the share action</p>

<div style="display: flex;">
    <p style="width:70%;">The user is able to track new food intake by pressing the relevant button on the home screen.</br>
        Here they can enter the relevant values in a format similar to that found on most conventional food items.</br>
        The graphic will change to reflect the UK health guidelines and the traffic light standard.</br>
        The user can then enter how many portions of the entered food they have eaten.</br>
        When the user presses save the information is saved and shown in the Home screen.</p>

    <p style="width:70%;">When tracking water the user will instead use the interactive drag/swipe functionality to select the quantity of water they have consumed.</p>

<div style="display: flex;">
    <p style="width:70%;">A user may see their past records by visiting the Calendar.</br>
        The Calendar displays the last 28 days and the points that the user scored on that day.</br>
        This page also displays statistics such as the users current score, highscore and streak.</br>
        From here the user is also able to plan meals by pressing the button to open whe calendar app where they can choose a day and write details for their food.</p>

<p style="width:70%;">Should a user wish to do so, they can share their score by using the share function on the apps taskbar.</p>

<div style="display: flex;">
    <p style="width:70%;">For ease of testing and for the purposes of this demonstration I have added a developer page to the profile.</br>
        Here it is possible to set the apps notifications to go off much faster, rather than every few hours, or to manually pass a day.</p>
